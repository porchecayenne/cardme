# cardme

This is an attempt to realize the idea of being able to see on-chain information in AR.

### How to use

First, open the site and activate the camera.
Next, take a picture of my card with the camera.

Then you can get the on-chain information.

### Future Work

This project could not yet be implemented to the phase of actually taking on-chain information. So I would like to update the API or something to get the current blockchain information associated with the wallet address.
